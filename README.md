# concert-ticket-distribution-system
this is a group project that i did with my colleague base on c programming

This project focuses on studying and developing a ticketing system, which is very interesting because it applies technology and data structures in its management. By understanding and improving this system, we can apply knowledge from the course CPE112: Data Structure.

The main features include:

The system can simulate concert ticket sales with non-assigned seating.

Data structures are used to develop and manage the system effectively.

The system can display ticket information and details to users.
